# class-1


 This repository is created for giving Demo on Git & Git Hub.


 things I did for making this repository.

 + Created a empty repository named `class-1` in [GitHub](https://github.com/new).
 + Copied the contents from the page titiled `created a new repository on the command line` and the
 lines are
 ```
 echo "# class-1" >> README.md
 git init
 git add .
 git commit -m "first commit"
 git branch -M main
 git remote add origin https://github.com/denial-E/class-1.git
 git push -u origin main
 
 ```
 + I have created an empty folder in my file explorer and opened the folder in CMD. After opened CMD
  I just copy pasted and executed the lines one by one.
    + This First line `echo "# class-1" >> README.md` created an README.md file with the
 content 1`"# class-1"`.
